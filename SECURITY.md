# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version    | Supported          |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Current    | :white_check_mark: |
| < Current  | :x:                |

## Responsible Disclosure
We will honor and expect a reporter to adhere to Google's Disclosure Policy - specifically Google Project Zero. Please see [this link](https://about.google/appsecurity/) for more information on how Google's general process is maintained and [this link](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html) for information on Google Project Zero.

## Guidelines
Under this policy, "research" means activities in which you:

- Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
- Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability's presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish persistent command line access, or use the exploit to pivot to other systems.
- **Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.**
- Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report all vulnerabilities to **security@macadmins.io**. Reports may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days. We do not support PGP-encrypted emails at this time.

### What we would like to see from you
In order to help us triage and prioritize submissions, we recommend that your reports:

- Describe the location the vulnerability was discovered and the potential impact of exploitation.
- Offer a detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful).
- Be in English, if possible.

### What you can expect from us
When you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible.

- Within 3 business days, we will acknowledge that your report has been received.
- To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to you and be as transparent as possible about what steps we are taking during the remediation process, including on issues or challenges that may delay resolution.
- We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.

Nudge is maintained almost exclusively by a single author, Erik Gomez. Upon reporting the vulnerability, please expect at least an additional 2-3 business days to assess the report. This time is loose and may be shorter or longer depending on availability of the author.

Upon review, the vulnerability will be assigned the following four levels: Low, Medium, High and Critical.

SLAs will be currently defined per the following guidlines

| Criticality | Time to remediation |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Critical    | 7 Business Days     |
| High        | 14 Business Days    |
| Medium      | 30 Business Days    |
| Low         | 90 Business Days    |

## Payment
At this time, we are not able to compensate for any reports submitted.
